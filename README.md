## Overview 🌟
Welcome to this guided project about creating a voice assistant using OpenAI and IBM Watson Speech Libraries for Embed. The guided project takes you through building a virtual assistant that can take voice input, convert it to text using speech-to-text technology, send the text to OpenAI’s GPT-3 model, receive a response, convert it to speech using text-to-speech technology and finally play it back to the user. The voice assistant will have a responsive front-end using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and a reliable back-end using Flask.

By the end of the course, you will have a deep understanding of voice assistants and the skills to create your own AI-powered assistant that can communicate through voice input and output. You will also have a strong foundation in web development using Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and a finished full stack application that is sure to impress anyone that comes across it!
